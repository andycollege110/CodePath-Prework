Cool Features: Its a 2 in 1 app containing both the car platform and the uber eats version. You can easily switch between them without having to download the other app.

## Notes
An app that I believe would be cool to create will be sort of a match making app, that could be used by students from a certain school to find their "match" ONLY in the school that they attend. Therefore, they could use my platform or app to find and surround themselves with students from the same school that have similar interests. I think it would be cool to implement a countdown to slowly reveal who the person matched with depending on their answers to questions. 

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

At first it was difficult to get familiarized with swift and using XCode but after using all the helpful links that were provided it made it a lot easier to understand everything the IDE contains as well as programming in Swift. It was also difficult to understand how find certain folders because there were a lot of them.
